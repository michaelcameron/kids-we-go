                The Minneapolis Sculpture Garden is one of the crown jewels of the city’s park system, uniting two of Minnesota’s most cherished resources—its greenspace and its cultural life. The 11-acre site Directions, home to the iconic Spoonbridge and Cherry, showcases more than 40 works from the Walker Art Center’s renowned collection. A partnership with the Minneapolis Park & Recreation Board, the Garden is a top destination for visitors, who enjoy not only the art but also the seasonal displays in the Cowles Conservatoryi and the Alene Grossman Memorial Arbor and Flower Garden.
